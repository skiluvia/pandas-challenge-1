Module 4 Challenge pandas-challenge-1

# Background
Welcome to this module challenge focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library. As a crucial component in various fields, such as data science, machine learning, and business intelligence, practical data analysis involves examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets. This assignment provides a hands-on opportunity to develop these skills.

In this challenge, we'll dive into a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring and analyzing data to address real-world business questions. Your mission will involve identifying top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more. The goal is to have a practical understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis, preparing you for more complex data scenarios in your future career.

# Exploration and Analysis
We will explore data and analyse on many ways
-   Viewing Column names
-   what describe function shows
-   Correctly identify the category with the most entries
-   For the category with the most entries, correctly identify the subcategory with the most entries
-   Correctly identify the 5 clients with the most entries in the data
-   Store the client ids of those top 5 clients in a lis
-   Display the total units (the qty column) that the client with the most entries ordered

# Data Transformation
-   Create a column that calculates the subtotal for each line using the unit_price and the qty
-   Create a column for shipping price. Assume a shipping price of $7 per pound for orders over 50 pounds and $10 per pound for items 50 pounds or under
-   Create a column for the total price using the subtotal and the shipping price along with a sales tax of 9.25%
-   Create a column for the cost of each line using unit cost, qty, and shipping price (assume the shipping cost is exactly what is charged to the client)
-   Create a column for the profit of each line using line cost and line price

# Summary
-   Calculate the total revenue from each of the top 5 clients in Part 1.
-   Create a summary DataFrame showing the totals for the top 5 clients with the following information: total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit. Sort by total profit
-   Format the data and rename the columns to names suitable for presentation. Currency should be in millions of dollars
-   Write a brief 2-3 sentence summary of your findings
